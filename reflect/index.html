        <p><a href="#love0">Preface</a> to the Love Series.</pp>
        <p>The majority of comments under those now-ubiquitous clips of people “rizzing” each other up (Hello, Algorithm. Are your feeds infested with these too? No? Just mine? Does that make me more or less qualified to talk about love?) usually say something like, “This only works if you’re tall and wildly attractive. If I did that, I’d get arrested.” Probably true. “Height and pretty privilege” is real. But another huge factor—one these comment sections never fail to point out—is confidence.</p>
<p>When my friends (and sometimes acquaintances) are in the ‘talking stage,’ we talk about it. A lot. Ooo, I love me some drama—especially when it’s not mine (by the way, how many stages are there before a relationship?). Anyway, we ask questions. Tons of them. What are they like? What do you like about them? What do you not like about them? Are they attractive? Have they done anything that irks you yet? Have you made a move? Have they? All valid questions. Definitely fun ones. But maybe we’re not asking the right ones.</p>
<p>Perhaps the better questions to ask are the ones about us. How do we feel when we’re around them? What do we like about ourselves in their presence? Are we more playful? More energetic? More lighthearted? Do they make us a better listener? A better sharer? Do we feel like we shrink—or soften? Do we feel seen—or just desired? Both? Neither?</p>
<p>Notice: these are all comparison-based questions—filled with phrases like “more this,” “less than,” words ending in -er, and sentences that end with question marks—perhaps much like the questions we ask ourselves when we’re with them. How do they compare to our past dates? Our ex? Smarter? More caring? Less perceptive? Cuter nose? Of course, the key distinction is that the important questions compare us to ourselves. Sure, the cliché “do we feel ourselves when we’re around them” comes to mind—and while that question is critical, it only scratches the surface. As one of my favorite sayings goes: stereotypes and clichés are true, but incomplete.</p>
	<p>Of course, we want to feel comfortable and like ourselves around the person we might spend the rest of our lives with. That’s the goal, right? The problem is, “feeling ourselves” isn’t easy to define. Perhaps a great place to start is one of the most fundamental questions in all of life: who are you? We get asked who we are all the time—when we make a decision (cheese curds or fries for the table?), when we meet someone new (“Hi, I’m Otter. And you are...?”), at job interviews (“Tell me about yourself”), when we set goals (“Who do we want to be?”), and even when we pray (I’ll leave this one up to your imagination). And yet if we’re being real, the answers never come easy.</p>
	<p>Who we are is such a difficult question because we’re different people all the time. A small digression that might deserve its own post: while I agree that some people can be “fake” and truly embody what that word means, I dislike its literal definition. We often call people “fake” when they act differently around different people—when their values, intentions, or vibes shift drastically. But ask yourself this: are there any two people in your life you interact with the same way, where you are the same person? You’re certainly not the same person with your best friend as you are with your boss or parents.</p> 
<p>Would it be fair, then, for your boss to call you fake if she caught you laughing your ass off at lunch—only for you to notice her and suddenly adjust your collar and sip your tea? Of course not. We are different versions of the same person in different situations, choosing which parts of ourselves to bring forward—not abandoning who we are. So, who are you? And how do we tell which versions of us are the “real” us? Maybe not the hottest take, but I’d argue it’s when we’re alone.</p> 
<p>If you’re thinking, “Well, I’ll find someone I can be exactly like when I’m alone”—if only it were that easy. Often, relationships are about working as a team toward both shared and individual goals, and that usually involves compromise. So, what are your negotiables and non-negotiables?</p>
	<p>By this point, if you’re bored and thinking, “Wow, you said all that and only now are we getting to the punchline?” — the answer is yes. One thing you should know about me: I’m a generational yapper. (It took me a while to admit that—only recently, actually. Maybe more on that another time.) Anyway, if you’re bored, go watch Groundhog Day. Watch Phil go from hating himself and the world, taking shortcuts, to realizing he’s all alone—and that he’s all he’s got. Then watch him work on himself, learn to love himself, and finally find love—love that comes when he lets it come to him for a change.
	<p>The biggest reason my ex and I broke up (or at least one I tell myself—there’s probably a lot more to unpack there another time) was because I was moving away. Growing up, I always thought of myself as confident, independent, and successful. I had great hobbies, friends, work, interests. When we broke up, I felt mostly fine—so fine that I felt guilty. Maybe I didn’t love them enough. Maybe I was the problem. I had my friends, books, sports, work, writing—I kept myself occupied. </p>
<p>It wasn’t until I really moved away several months later that I realized I might not be as comfortable with myself as I thought—perhaps I was too confident in that belief. Without my friends and people to keep me busy, I felt alone. Lonely. I went on a string of uninspiring first dates, often subconsciously trying to be a little more of who I thought they wanted me to be than who I really was, never feeling much like myself. I realized what I needed wasn’t companionship—I needed clarity.</p>
	<p>I went back to doing the things I loved—alone—and tried to find joy in the little moments—in the ways I did before. It made me realize that my overwhelming need to please and be wanted in that relationship had quietly reshaped parts of me—in ways I wasn’t fully comfortable with after it ended, and, looking back, even while I was still in it.</p> 
<p>That said, before I move on, I want to reemphasize that I have nothing but amazing things to say about my ex. I learned more from our relationship than I could ever imagine, and for long stretches, I was as happy as I had ever been.</p>
<p>Anyway, I needed to rediscover myself. I needed to fall back on the ways I used to wind down, find ways to meet people through my hobbies, and spend time alone appreciating and reflecting on the little things that made me love <i>my</i> life. I went back to doing the things that made me comfortable and confident with myself before the relationship—the traits and characteristics that probably attracted my ex to me in the first place.</p>
<p>Maybe the reason my dates felt uninspiring wasn’t because I was too heartbroken or because they weren’t what I was looking for. Maybe it was because I’d spent so much time being a chameleon—I didn’t know what I actually wanted, and more importantly, I had forgotten who I was outside of that relationship.</p>
	<p>Like I said, I learned an incredible amount from my first and only (yeah yeah, rub it in) relationship. The most important lesson didn’t come all at once—it came through deep reflection during lonely days by the lake, slow long runs, and meandering walks down pretty much every street in the town I moved to: how essential it is to first, love yourself.</p>
<p>Know your character. Know your values, your morals. Know what makes you happy. Know your goals and dreams. Know your hobbies. And be ready to talk about them—articulately. When we’re passionate about something, our energy radiates to those around us. It’s easy to get excited about things that others are excited about, to care about things that others care about, too. Be a version of yourself you’re proud of. Work toward a <i>you</i> you love. Of course, that doesn’t guarantee you’ll find a relationship quickly, but at this point—so what? You are happy with yourself. And when the right person comes along, there will be no wrong time, because you’ll be ready and beyond excited to share something love and care deeply about: yourself.</p>
	<p>So, next time you’re preparing to go on a date, ask yourself: what parts of you do you care about most, value most, and love most? And afterwards, ask yourself whether you see them caring for, valuing, and loving those parts of you as much as you do — because when you’ve built a self you love, you stop looking for someone who completes you and start looking for someone to share it all with. That person won’t just make you feel desired. They’ll make you feel recognized. And it’ll feel easy — because they’ll love you for everything you love about yourself.</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="love0" class="tab-expanded">
        <p>I preface this series by saying I’m certainly not the most traditionally “qualified” to talk about love—or
          the quest for it. On any tangible metric, many would probably argue I’ve been unsuccessful in this area. By my
          estimation, I’ve loved three people in my life (romantically)—but I’ve only ever been on one official second
          date (poor me?). That said, it did turn into a deeply meaningful and cherished—albeit short-lived—relationship
          that lasted just over a year.</p>
        <p>I doubt I’ll ever dedicate full posts to that relationship, but I suspect that as we venture further into
          this series, you’ll have a pretty good sense of what it was like—at least from my perspective.</p>
        <p>While I may not personally have a long list of credentials in the love department, thanks to my usual absence
          of social anxiety and general nosiness, I’ve third-wheeled and lived vicariously through many wildly
          successful—and shockingly (or in hindsight, rather unsurprisingly) unsuccessful—ones. (I promise that despite
          these experiences, I am quite socially aware and rarely, if ever, overstay my welcome. Or maybe people just
          love having me around. Hmm.)</p>
        <p>I’d also like to proudly point out the <i>wildly impressive</i> one-to-one second-date-to-respectable-(and
          successful?)-relationship ratio. Despite <i>that</i> crown jewel achievement, most would still probably rank
          me well below average when it comes to giving dating and relationship advice.</p>
        <p>That said, those around me—acquaintances (low-key lots of fun stories there), friends, family—often turn to
          me for relationship advice, and many say I have high emotional intelligence. Whatever that means. Take it as
          you will.</p>
        <p>Finally, everyone’s journey with love (and with most things in life) is deeply personal. I won’t pretend to
          have all the answers. This series, like everything I write, is simply me sifting through what I’ve observed,
          learned, questioned, talked about, thought about, and experienced—words, moments, and stories I find valuable
          and worth sharing.</p>
        <p>So, let’s get into it. This is gonna be fun — and hopefully as meaningful for you to read as it is for me to
          write.</p>
