      <div class="tab-expanded">
        <p>I grew up going to church every Sunday. It was boring — really boring. But to me, it was worth it, because
          Sunday wasn’t just church day. It was family day. After morning mass, my cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandma
          would all head to long lunches, then migrate to one of our homes and continue with huge family cookouts —
          barbecue, Chinese, Thai, Mexican, Italian, French. You name it, we’ve made it. These were elaborate family
          affairs, beginning with recipe planning, grocery runs, cooking, eating, and hanging out that stretched well
          into the night. </p>

        <p>So the lunch I shared with my aunt the other day took me by complete surprise. </p>

        <p>We were talking about my grandma — her mom — who had just suffered a second life-changing stroke in five
          years. She said, “You know, this whole situation may have made me have real belief. Real belief in God.” </p>

        <p>“What do you mean?” I was gobsmacked. This aunt has been one of the most consistent churchgoers, Bible
          readers, and prayer leaders I’ve ever known. She regularly went on short-term local mission trips. The thought
          that she hadn’t been a true believer — not fully — felt quietly world-shattering. So I asked her questions.
        </p>

        <p>She told me she had done all those things because she really, really wanted to believe. But deep down, she’d
          been too proud, too sure that her successes and abilities were hers alone — not gifts from anyone, especially
          not from God. She said she had read the Bible cover to cover more than fifteen times. She went to church
          groups during the week just to hear about other people’s journeys toward faith — the stories that had grounded
          them in belief. But none of it ever resonated with her. </p>

        <p>She told me stories of people whose spiritual awakenings were so simple, they almost sounded made up. Some
          were so wild, I wouldn’t believe them if I didn’t know better. A toll booth operator who came because someone
          handed them a flyer. Someone else who showed up just because they found one on the street.</p>

        <p>She grew envious of them. No one she met had seemed more willing to accept God than she was — and yet God
          spoke to them in ways she could never understand. Until she understood. </p>

        <p>She told me that something about the circumstances surrounding our family during my grandma’s illness — and
          the long, uncertain recovery that followed — finally broke through. It made her a believer in a way she
          couldn’t explain, even to herself.</p>

        <p>In the end, with tears welling in her eyes — though I couldn’t tell if they came from finding faith, talking
          about her mom, reflecting on family, or some mix of all three — she said, “What I’ve learned is that religion
          is deeply, deeply personal, and no two journeys toward — or with — faith and belief are the same. We each get
          to engage with them in our own way, and on our own terms.”</p>

        <p>That struck a deep chord in me. It perfectly captured my own complicated relationship with faith and
          religion. Growing up, it was often hard to talk about what I believed with my family, because my level of
          faith never quite felt like it matched theirs. Hearing about my aunt’s struggles with belief — my aunt, whose
          faith had always seemed unwavering — and hearing her say, “Religion is deeply personal,” was exactly what I
          needed.</p>

        <p>My relationship with religion has stretched, unraveled, and reknit itself numerous times over — sometimes
          into faith, sometimes into doubt, sometimes into nothing at all, and often into something quietly in between.
        </p>

        <p>In my early childhood, if anyone had asked me whether I was religious, it would have been an unequivocal yes.
          My whole family was Christian. So, I was too. </p>

        <p>In my preteen years, I started to ask questions. I started to grow intellectually in tangible ways and
          suddenly, the world seemed too small for both science and religion. With that said, I held on as long as I
          could. </p>

        <p>I refused to believe that most — if not all — of the adults in my family, people who believed intensely and
          lived generously, were simply wrong. That they were so insecure or short-sighted that they needed to rely on
          the idea of a higher being. Did they really give away money to the church every Sunday, sometimes in large
          amounts, so God would forgive them for their sins? What burdens were they carrying that made them feel the
          need to talk to someone, or maybe to themselves, before every meal, and again before bed?</p>

        <p>I have never liked things I didn’t understand. And I did not understand a lot.</p>

        <p>Much of the faith I had back then was: I was smart and I kept winning soccer games — it had to be God given
          talent. But if I were being completely honest, that faith was solidified by the little mind games I played
          with myself. Here’s a classic, amusing example — and a glimpse into my odd mind, one I continue to be
          pleasantly surprised by: Some days, I’d say to myself, “Okay fine. If God were real, I’ll take the stairs up
          to my apartment. On other days, “If God is real, I’ll take the elevator.” When I had a big test, I’d ask God
          for the will power and focus to study. And for years, every day, God was real.</p>

        <p>When I stepped into my teenage years, pride and arrogance were already waiting for me. Competitive soccer
          entered the picture, and with weekly games on Sundays, I stopped going to church. I was late to family
          cookouts, sometimes missing them entirely. I felt myself growing — not just physically, but intellectually, as
          a scientist, a logician. I felt I didn’t need religion or faith. I started to believe I might be smarter than
          even the adults around me. Slowly, they could answer my questions less and less. And with that, my faith began
          to waver. The anchors that once held it steady — family, tradition, small affirmations from daily life —
          started to slip away. I began to see my old mind games for what I thought they were: the silly delusions of a
          naive ten-year-old.</p>

        <p>Despite straying away from my faith, I continued to defend religion — not because I still believed, but
          because it has been undeniably meaningful. It has kept me disciplined. It has made me a better person. Most of
          all, it brought me closer to my family.. It has even contributed to my self-confidence and sense of belief in
          myself.</p>

        <p>That changed after a conversation I had with one of my closest friends in middle school. We were talking, as
          we often did, about life, philosophy, and physics — so it made sense that religion would eventually find its
          way into the mix. We discussed the benefits of religion, the damage done in its name, the wars, the conflicts,
          the cruelty people justified through faith. She asked how anyone could believe in a God who allowed so much
          suffering. I did my best to defend faith — not necessarily belief in God, but faith as something useful,
          something good. </p>

        <p>I said, “at least on a personal level. Religion, I said, is good for us.” And I thought I had convinced her.
          I was wrong.</p>

        <p>She was quiet for a moment, then said, “Yeah, I guess… I don’t think I could ever believe.”</p>

        <p>I asked, “Why not?”</p>

        <p>She said, “If God were real, God wouldn’t have taken my older brother away from me.”</p>

        <p>Her brother had collapsed and died suddenly on the school soccer field on a hot summer day, the victim of an
          undetected genetic heart condition. I had no response to that. What could I possibly say? Why would a loving
          God take so much from one of the kindest families I knew — and from someone I cared about? God couldn’t be
          real.</p>

        <p>What followed was a stretch of a few years where I was as out of touch with religion as I’d ever been. I
          occasionally went to church to see family, attended mass grudgingly, and spent most of my time poking holes in
          the sermons. </p>

        <p>And yet, anytime I felt trapped, overworked, or overwhelmed, I prayed. Every single time. And I always
          started the way I was taught: by giving thanks for everything I had going for me. </p>

        <p>As I got older and my world expanded, I realized how naive I had been — and how naive I still am. The more I
          learned, the less I felt like I knew. The wiser I believed myself to be, the more humbled I became. And the
          more freedom my parents gave me to make my own decisions, the more I saw how rarely their advice missed the
          mark. They’re almost always right. Gradually, I learned to give their words the weight they deserved, instead
          of brushing them off with irritation. I began paying closer attention to how each of my family members related
          to faith — how it shaped them, and how it evolved over time.</p>

        <p>As my faith faded, my parents’ only deepened. My dad — once the least religious of his five siblings — found
          himself more and more drawn to belief. My mom, who had married into a religious family, did too. In the
          background, the gratitude portion of my rare but oddly consistent prayers kept growing. It got longer. More
          sincere.</p>

        <p>My rekindled relationship with religion came from a wildly unexpected source: college applications. That
          season gave me space to reflect on different parts of my life — the highlights, the struggles, the hard work,
          the growth. To my surprise, most of the stories I considered worth telling felt incomplete without
          acknowledging my relationship with religion. I kept circling back to questions of belief — how it had quietly
          shaped me, motivated me, and kept me grounded in academics, sports, and service. I thought about it so often
          that this unexpected closeness with religion and theology inspired me to apply to college as a physics,
          philosophy, and religious studies major. For full disclosure, I ended up a math major, but that’s besides the
          point.</p>

        <p>A big part of my newfound humility and awakening was recognizing that religions are constantly evolving
          belief systems — intricately intertwined with human history, stretching back thousands of years. It began to
          feel deeply arrogant to dismiss them entirely as nothing more than collections of mechanisms born from
          ignorance or wishful thinking — as if they were inherently at odds with science.</p>

        <p>With that realization, I stopped needing religion to be airtight, historically verified, or perfectly
          logical. Instead, I began to notice how it shows up in people’s daily lives — and how much they benefit from
          it. My perspective shifted: not all of religion needs to be taken literally, and many spiritual practices
          aren’t necessarily about strict belief or flawless theology. In fact, many are rooted in biology, psychology,
          and anthropology — and reflect fundamental understandings of what it means to be human.</p>

        <p>Some of the oldest spiritual practices have lasted not because they demand blind belief, but because they
          work. Prayer, for example, can act as a mental reset — a moment to reorient ourselves, express gratitude, set
          goals, and reflect on what matters. Weekly services offer structure, rhythm, and social connection. Fasting
          invites empathy and self-discipline. Simple blessings before meals remind us to pause and appreciate. Acts of
          service turn belief into tangible love. Lighting candles or observing a Sabbath builds space for rest and
          peace in a chaotic world. </p>

        <p>Sacred texts and stories, too, can be read not as rigid instruction manuals or historical records, but as
          layered metaphors — full of timeless insight. And practices like meditation, silence, pilgrimage, chanting, or
          morning rituals aren’t about proving anything. They’re about living each day with more intention. More
          humility. And, paradoxically, more confidence.</p>

        <p>More tangibly, spiritual teachings offer concrete ways to live good lives — to live with more empathy,
          discipline, and presence. Take “Do good and good will come to you,” or the idea of karma. It fosters
          reciprocity and trust. Kindness — especially when it's consistent and not self-serving — is contagious. It
          generates goodwill. People remember it. It shifts atmospheres, opens doors, and returns to us in ways that
          aren't always visible but are deeply felt. “Turn the other cheek” and “Forgive seventy times seven” ask us to
          resist retaliation and let go of bitterness — not for the sake of passivity, but for peace. These are
          difficult, but profoundly human practices that protect both our relationships and our peace of mind.
          Similarly, “The meek shall inherit the earth” reframes power entirely, reminding us that humility, not
          dominance, is what endures. </p>

        <p>Other teachings point inward. “Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also” speaks to how our
          attention shapes our identity. “Judge not, lest ye be judged” reminds us to lead with compassion rather than
          assumptions. From Buddhism, “Everything is impermanent” helps us meet change with perspective instead of
          panic. And the Bhagavad Gita’s “Do your duty without attachment to results” calls us to embrace the process
          rather than obsess over the outcome — reminding us that peace often comes from effort, not control. Across
          traditions, these teachings reflect a kind of deep psychological wisdom — not demands for blind belief, but
          enduring tools for becoming better, more grounded, more generous people.</p>

        <p>Today, I find it difficult to say that I truly believe in any single religion, doctrine, or God. </p>

        <p>My go-to response when people ask if I’m religious is to ask them the same question first. If they say yes, I
          say I’m not; if they say no, I say I am.</p>

        <p>If I had to label myself, I’d call myself agnostic—one who leans heavily toward the possibility of a higher
          power or higher being, though I don’t know which one. In many ways, this openness feels necessary. It allows
          me to engage with spiritual teachings and practices across traditions honestly and without dogma, adapting
          them to fit my life and growth. I don’t need perfect answers or airtight belief for these practices to be
          meaningful or effective. Instead, I find value in how they cultivate humility, compassion, and intention. </p>

        <p>My journey has been less about absolute faith and more about deep personal exploration—questioning, doubting,
          learning, and evolving. I’ve taken what resonates, left behind what doesn’t, and continuously reshaped my
          understanding of what spirituality means to me. Ultimately, what has stayed constant is the recognition that
          religion is deeply personal. Each of us must find our own way to connect with what grounds us, guides us, and
          brings meaning to our lives.</p>

        <p>If nothing else, this personal tug of war has made me more receptive to new perspectives, open to meeting new
          people, and eager to keep learning.</p>

        <p>I close with a quote from one of my favorite shows of all time, Person of Interest. Wildly different context,
          but undeniably relevant: “What Cyrus believes, it helps him. And who am I to say he’s wrong.”</p>

          that, I’d get arrested.” Probably true. “Height and pretty privilege” is real. But another huge factor—one
          these comment sections never fail to point out—is confidence.</p>
        <p>When my friends (and sometimes acquaintances) are in the ‘talking stage,’ we talk about it. A lot. Ooo, I
          love me some drama—especially when it’s not mine (by the way, how many stages are there before a
          relationship?). Anyway, we ask questions. Tons of them. What are they like? What do you like about them? What
          do you not like about them? Are they attractive? Have they done anything that irks you yet? Have you made a
          move? Have they? All valid questions. Definitely fun ones. But maybe we’re not asking the right ones.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the better questions to ask are the ones about us. How do we feel when we’re around them? What do we
          like about ourselves in their presence? Are we more playful? More energetic? More lighthearted? Do they make
          us a better listener? A better sharer? Do we feel like we shrink—or soften? Do we feel seen—or just desired?
          Both? Neither?</p>
        <p>Notice: these are all comparison-based questions—filled with phrases like “more this,” “less than,” words
          ending in -er, and sentences that end with question marks—perhaps much like the questions we ask ourselves
          when we’re with them. How do they compare to our past dates? Our ex? Smarter? More caring? Less perceptive?
          Cuter nose? Of course, the key distinction is that the important questions compare us to ourselves. Sure, the
          cliché “do we feel ourselves when we’re around them” comes to mind—and while that question is critical, it
          only scratches the surface. As one of my favorite sayings goes: stereotypes and clichés are true, but
          incomplete.</p>
        <p>Of course, we want to feel comfortable and like ourselves around the person we might spend the rest of our
          lives with. That’s the goal, right? The problem is, “feeling ourselves” isn’t easy to define. Perhaps a great
          place to start is one of the most fundamental questions in all of life: who are you? We get asked who we are
          all the time—when we make a decision (cheese curds or fries for the table?), when we meet someone new (“Hi,
          I’m Otter. And you are...?”), at job interviews (“Tell me about yourself”), when we set goals (“Who do we want
          to be?”), and even when we pray (I’ll leave this one up to your imagination). And yet if we’re being real, the
          answers never come easy.</p>
        <p>Who we are is such a difficult question because we’re different people all the time. A small digression that
          might deserve its own post: while I agree that some people can be “fake” and truly embody what that word
          means, I dislike its literal definition. We often call people “fake” when they act differently around
          different people—when their values, intentions, or vibes shift drastically. But ask yourself this: are there
          any two people in your life you interact with the same way, where you are the same person? You’re certainly
          not the same person with your best friend as you are with your boss or parents.</p>
        <p>Would it be fair, then, for your boss to call you fake if she caught you laughing your ass off at lunch—only
          for you to notice her and suddenly adjust your collar and sip your tea? Of course not. We are different
          versions of the same person in different situations, choosing which parts of ourselves to bring forward—not
          abandoning who we are. So, who are you? And how do we tell which versions of us are the “real” us? Maybe not
          the hottest take, but I’d argue it’s when we’re alone.</p>
        <p>If you’re thinking, “Well, I’ll find someone I can be exactly like when I’m alone”—if only it were that easy.
          Often, relationships are about working as a team toward both shared and individual goals, and that usually
          involves compromise. So, what are your negotiables and non-negotiables?</p>
        <p>By this point, if you’re bored and thinking, “Wow, you said all that and only now are we getting to the
          punchline?” — the answer is yes. One thing you should know about me: I’m a generational yapper. (It took me a
          while to admit that—only recently, actually. Maybe more on that another time.) Anyway, if you’re bored, go
          watch Groundhog Day. Watch Phil go from hating himself and the world, taking shortcuts, to realizing he’s all
          alone—and that he’s all he’s got. Then watch him work on himself, learn to love himself, and finally find
          love—love that comes when he lets it come to him for a change.
        <p>The biggest reason my ex and I broke up (or at least one I tell myself—there’s probably a lot more to unpack
          there another time) was because I was moving away. Growing up, I always thought of myself as confident,
          independent, and successful. I had great hobbies, friends, work, interests. When we broke up, I felt mostly
          fine—so fine that I felt guilty. Maybe I didn’t love them enough. Maybe I was the problem. I had my friends,
          books, sports, work, writing—I kept myself occupied. </p>
        <p>It wasn’t until I really moved away several months later that I realized I might not be as comfortable with
          myself as I thought—perhaps I was too confident in that belief. Without my friends and people to keep me busy,
          I felt alone. Lonely. I went on a string of uninspiring first dates, often subconsciously trying to be a
          little more of who I thought they wanted me to be than who I really was, never feeling much like myself. I
          realized what I needed wasn’t companionship—I needed clarity.</p>
        <p>I went back to doing the things I loved—alone—and tried to find joy in the little moments—in the ways I did
          before. It made me realize that my overwhelming need to please and be wanted in that relationship had quietly
          reshaped parts of me—in ways I wasn’t fully comfortable with after it ended, and, looking back, even while I
          was still in it.</p>
        <p>That said, before I move on, I want to reemphasize that I have nothing but amazing things to say about my ex.
          I learned more from our relationship than I could ever imagine, and for long stretches, I was as happy as I
          had ever been.</p>
        <p>Anyway, I needed to rediscover myself. I needed to fall back on the ways I used to wind down, find ways to
          meet people through my hobbies, and spend time alone appreciating and reflecting on the little things that
          made me love <i>my</i> life. I went back to doing the things that made me comfortable and confident with
          myself before the relationship—the traits and characteristics that probably attracted my ex to me in the first
          place.</p>
        <p>Maybe the reason my dates felt uninspiring wasn’t because I was too heartbroken or because they weren’t what
          I was looking for. Maybe it was because I’d spent so much time being a chameleon—I didn’t know what I actually
          wanted, and more importantly, I had forgotten who I was outside of that relationship.</p>
        <p>Like I said, I learned an incredible amount from my first and only (yeah yeah, rub it in) relationship. The
          most important lesson didn’t come all at once—it came through deep reflection during lonely days by the lake,
          slow long runs, and meandering walks down pretty much every street in the town I moved to: how essential it is
          to first, love yourself.</p>
        <p>Know your character. Know your values, your morals. Know what makes you happy. Know your goals and dreams.
          Know your hobbies. And be ready to talk about them—articulately. When we’re passionate about something, our
          energy radiates to those around us. It’s easy to get excited about things that others are excited about, to
          care about things that others care about, too. Be a version of yourself you’re proud of. Work toward a
          <i>you</i> you love. Of course, that doesn’t guarantee you’ll find a relationship quickly, but at this
          point—so what? You are happy with yourself. And when the right person comes along, there will be no wrong
          time, because you’ll be ready and beyond excited to share something love and care deeply about: yourself.</p>
        <p>So, next time you’re preparing to go on a date, ask yourself: what parts of you do you care about most, value
          most, and love most? And afterwards, ask yourself whether you see them caring for, valuing, and loving those
          parts of you as much as you do — because when you’ve built a self you love, you stop looking for someone who
          completes you and start looking for someone to share it all with. That person won’t just make you feel
          desired. They’ll make you feel recognized. And it’ll feel easy — because they’ll love you for everything you
          love about yourself.</p>

      <div id="love0" class="tab-expanded">
        <p>I preface this series by saying I’m certainly not the most traditionally “qualified” to talk about love—or
          the quest for it. On any tangible metric, many would probably argue I’ve been unsuccessful in this area. By my
          estimation, I’ve loved three people in my life (romantically)—but I’ve only ever been on one official second
          date (poor me?). That said, it did turn into a deeply meaningful and cherished—albeit short-lived—relationship
          that lasted just over a year.</p>
        <p>I doubt I’ll ever dedicate full posts to that relationship, but I suspect that as we venture further into
          this series, you’ll have a pretty good sense of what it was like—at least from my perspective.</p>
        <p>While I may not personally have a long list of credentials in the love department, thanks to my usual absence
          of social anxiety and general nosiness, I’ve third-wheeled and lived vicariously through many wildly
          successful—and shockingly (or in hindsight, rather unsurprisingly) unsuccessful—ones. (I promise that despite
          these experiences, I am quite socially aware and rarely, if ever, overstay my welcome. Or maybe people just
          love having me around. Hmm.)</p>
        <p>I’d also like to proudly point out the <i>wildly impressive</i> one-to-one second-date-to-respectable-(and
          successful?)-relationship ratio. Despite <i>that</i> crown jewel achievement, most would still probably rank
          me well below average when it comes to giving dating and relationship advice.</p>
        <p>That said, those around me—acquaintances (low-key lots of fun stories there), friends, family—often turn to
          me for relationship advice, and many say I have high emotional intelligence. Whatever that means. Take it as
          you will.</p>
        <p>Finally, everyone’s journey with love (and with most things in life) is deeply personal. I won’t pretend to
          have all the answers. This series, like everything I write, is simply me sifting through what I’ve observed,
          learned, questioned, talked about, thought about, and experienced—words, moments, and stories I find valuable
          and worth sharing.</p>
        <p>So, let’s get into it. This is gonna be fun — and hopefully as meaningful for you to read as it is for me to
          write.</p>
