        <p>... from having to carry it so hard all these years.</p>p
        
        <p>One of my good friends is traveling through Europe. The other day she complained about how train delays and misschedules made her routine two hour trip from Madrid to Valencia a seven hour endeavor. Instead of arriving at 11 pm, she arrived at 4 am. Oof. </p>

<p>That got me thinking: Europe → Incompetency → Greece (sorry Greece). Over the past few decades, I’ve occasionally, but consistently, heard about Greece’s financial chaos in the context of the Eurozone and the EU. I guess that’s why my train of thought ended up there. The brain works in mysterious ways. So I decided to dig deeper.</p>

<p>Here’s a little bit about the European Union, the Eurozone, and how Greece fits into the picture.</p>

<p><b>First,</b> let’s talk about a clear key identifying feature between the European Union (EU) and the Eurozone. The EU (27 countries) is a group of countries in Europe where people, money, and goods move freely with minimal restrictions. Think of it as a shared neighborhood with no locks and open doors. The Eurozone (20 countries) is the group of EU countries that all use the same currency: the Euro.</p>

<p><b>Side Nugget:</b> Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the Schengen Area (29 countries) as an element within the wider area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ) policy of the EU. It mostly works like a single country for international travel purposes — one visa, one border check, lots of movement.</p>

<p><b>Another Nugget:</b> The EU has a long and intricate history, dating back to the post–World War II years. Its official founding moment came in 1993, with the Maastricht Treaty (aka the Treaty on European Union).</p>

<p><b>Yet Another Nugget:</b> The Eurozone was launched on January 1st, 1999 by 11 founding members. There could have — maybe should have — been 12, but the 12th didn’t make the cut. Why? Failed some economic tests (officially: the Maastricht criteria). Yup, you guessed it: Greece. After tightening things up, Greece passed a year later and officially joined in 2001 as the 12th member.</p>

<p><b>Yet Another One:</b> The EU has its own observer seat at the United Nations (UN), but each of its 27 member countries is a full UN member with its own seat and vote. So, the EU gets to talk, but not vote. Hello? Why?</p>

<p><b>Anyway, Greece.</b> Here's a short ramble — but a pretty juicy one.</p>

<p>So, like I said, the Eurozone club kicked off in 1999 with 11 members. Greece wasn’t allowed in because they didn’t meet the Maastricht criteria — a set of economic rules designed to keep the whole system stable. Understandably, Greece had been struggling with debt and poor fiscal discipline since the 1990s. Naturally, they felt left out. So how did they turn things around so quickly, meet the criteria, and join just two years later in 2001? </p>

<p>Simple. They lied. Classic little sibling move. They lied… to the EU. Bonkers.</p>

<p>After joining the Eurozone frenzy in 01, they felt more secure and overspent even more, especially towards… the 2004 Olympics. By the mid-2000s, its debt-to-GDP ratio (basically how much a country owes compared to how much it earns) was over 100%.</p>

<p>Then came the 2008 global financial crisis. Of course, Greece got exposed. Hard. The lies came back to haunt them. No one wanted to lend to them anymore, and they were shut out of the European bond market. They couldn’t borrow money? They couldn’t pay anyone back.</p>

<p><b>Quick Detour:</b> A financial default happens when someone — a person, company, or government — fails to pay back a loan on time. That’s what Greece was facing.</p>

<p>Growing restless, the EU’s big siblings swooped in to help: 3 bail outs totalling 260 billion euros. Imagine you mess up real bad and your family just throws money at you. Isn’t that great. Of course, there were harsh regulations on how they can spend it. </p>

<p>There were strict regulations, budget cuts, and tax hikes. Greece’s economy shrank by 25% between 2008 and 2013 — one of the worst post-war recessions in Europe. Unemployment hit 27%, youth unemployment over 50%. Public services were gutted. And their debt-to-GDP ratio? It peaked at 170%, one of the highest in the world.</p>

<p>Politically? Chaos. Greece cycled through frequent elections, radical parties gained traction, and the streets were filled with protests, strikes, and occasional violence. Negotiations with the EU were front-page news for years — and it exposed deep tensions between European countries over what solidarity really means.</p>

<p><b>Then came the ultimate “bruh” moment:</b></p>

<p>In 2015, Greece basically said “idgaf” about the bailout rules and… the EU hit back with even tougher ones. </p>

<p><i>Where’s Aristotle and Co. when you need them? I thought the Greeks were supposed to be smart.</i></p>


<p>Just when they were crawling out… COVID hit. As a tourism-reliant country, that really messed them up too. </p>

<p><b>Rip to the Eurozone’s Annoying Sibling Who Refuses to Grow Up. Rip Greece. </b></p>

<p>Over the past few years, they have been doing better though. Post pandemic, there’s been a surge in tourism, rising foreign investment, and EU recovery funds. Unemployment has gradually declined, and Greece even returned to investment-grade status in 2023 for the first time in over a decade — showing signs they might be able to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>However, challenges remain: public debt is still high, inflation has pressured households, and structural reforms are ongoing. Still, by post-crisis standards, Greece’s economic outlook is more stable and optimistic than it’s been in years.</p>
